career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an electronics engineer who graduated from Aalborg University in 2018 with a master's degree in signal processing. In addition to signal procesing, I have experience in the fields of data science, software development and public outreach.

      As a multipotentialite, I am curious by nature and a quick learner with a huge thirst for knowledge, meaning I have always been interested in understanding the world around me and questioned why things are the way they are.

      I have a passion for problem-solving, so I love using my palette of skills to think outside the box and come up with alternative ways to improve the way things work or are done.
education:
    - degree: MSc in Engineering, Signal Processing and Computing (SPC)
      university: Aalborg University, Denmark
      time: 2016 - 2018
      details: |
        Throughout my master’s degree, I have gained experience in the topics of signal modeling, -analysis & -detection, optimization methods, scientific computing and reconfigurable systems such as FPGAs.
        - Master Thesis: Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Using Constrained ICA
        - Weighted Average Mark: 12.0

    - degree: Exchange Student
      university: Aalto University, Finland
      time: 2017
      details: |
        Completed courses in statistical signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, speech processing, speech recognition and signal processing for communication systems.

    - degree: BSc in Electrical Engineering and IT, spec. in Communication Systems
      university: Aalborg University, Denmark
      time: 2013 - 2016
      details: |
        Throughout the bachelor, I have gained theoretical and practical knowledge regarding analog & digital systems, modeling and control, communication systems and signal processing.
          - Bachelor Thesis: Communication Link for a Cubesat - an SDR Approach
          - Weighted Average Mark: 11.2

experiences:
    - role: Engineering Fellow
      time: 2020 - 2021
      company: CERN, Geneva
      details: |
        Engineering fellow in the TE-MPE-EE section (machine protection and electrical integrity group, electrical engineering section) where I worked on electrical quality assurance (ELQA) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in particular the High-Luminosity LHC upgrade.
        I performed data analysis of frequency response measurements of the main dipole magnets of the LHC, and discovered a method for identifying potential outliers caused by e.g. interturn shorts. This aids in the hardware commissioning, thus reducing down-time of the LHC.
        In addition, I developed a Python algorithm for doing parameter estimation of superconducting magnets using PSpice circuit models. The algorithm fetches measurements from the ELQA database and iteratively fits circuit parameters by running Pspice. 
        This aids in doing model verification of LHC superconducting magnet models, thus giving a greater understanding of potential error modes.
