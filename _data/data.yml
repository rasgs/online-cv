career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an electronics engineer who graduated from Aalborg University in 2018 with a master's degree in signal processing. In addition to signal procesing, I have experience in the fields of data science, software development and public outreach.

      I am curious by nature and a quick learner with a huge thirst for knowledge, meaning I have always been interested in understanding the world around me and questioned why things are the way they are.

      Having a passion for problem-solving, I love using my palette of skills to think outside the box and come up with alternative ways to improve the way things work or are done.
